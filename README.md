# FIFA World Cup Data Dashboard

This project visualizes key statistics from historical FIFA World Cup tournaments using IBM Cognos Analytics.

## What the dashboard shows:
- Top goal-scoring teams  
- Tournament winners  
- Teams with the most matches played  
- Geographical visualization of participating countries  
- Performance trends over time  

## Tools Used:
- IBM Cognos Analytics  
- Microsoft Excel (for data preparation)

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this dashboard is available in this repository: [world cup 2014-2022.xlsx](./world%20cup%202014-2022.xlsx)

It includes World Cup statistics from 2014 to 2022, prepared and cleaned manually from public sources.

## Notes:
This is my first data project using IBM Cognos Analytics.  
It focuses on presenting clear KPIs, interactive elements, and visual storytelling to analyze World Cup history.

## How to Explore the Dashboard?

This dashboard was built using IBM Cognos Analytics, which currently doesn't support public embedding. However, if you're interested in seeing it in action, feel free to reach out via GitHub or check out the screenshots included above.

Future improvements may include:
- Making the dashboard interactive via embedded public link
- Adding statistics from earlier World Cup tournaments (before 2014)
- Including player-level data for deeper insights
